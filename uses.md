So here are a couple of tools I use on a daily basis. I'm listing them here as a reference for myself and maybe as an inspiration to some new tools for you as well :smiley:.

## Editor and Terminal

- [Visual Studio Code - Insider Build](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders)  
  I started to use VSCode from the very beginning, especially together with Angular 2 development and TypeScript. Although it was kinda painful initially, VSCode has become my editor of choice.  
  Here are the extensions and themes I currently use:
  `markdown-toc`, `EditorConfig`, `Bookmarks`, `theme-material-operator`, `theme-material-neutral`, `jshint`, `codeacejumper`, `Theme-MarkdownKit`, `vscode-icons`, `autoimport`, `gitblame`, `JasmineSnippets`, `markdown-authoring`
  
- [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/)  
   ...

- [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/)  
   Currenty my editor of choice for Java based development, although I use it rarely.

_(I previously used Sublime. [Here's my setup for that](/blog/2013/04/my-sublimetext-setup/))_
