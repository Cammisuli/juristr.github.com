# Talks
Some of the (so far mostly company internal) talks I gave and which I'd like to share here.

## <section class="last-changed">August 07, 2012</section> JavaScript - The Language
A introduction to JavaScript from the language point of view. Nothing about frameworks, but a presentation about the most common language features with the purpose to point out the possibilities and peculiarities the language brings with it.

The presentation has been created by using [impress.js](https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/) and is supposed to work in all modern browsers.
