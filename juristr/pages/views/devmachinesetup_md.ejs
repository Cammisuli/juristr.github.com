# Dev Machine Setup
<div id="toc"/>
This page list the setup of my developer machine. It is thought more as a reference for myself, but might be interesting for others as well.  
I previously [posted such setup on my blog](http://blog.js-development.com/2012/07/setting-up-my-developer-machine.html), but find this page more suitable as it'll get updated over time as I add/remove new tools from the list.
