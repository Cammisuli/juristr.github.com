# Setting up Jekyll

## Installation

### Install Ruby
On Windows I downloaded the according installer which can be found [here](http://rubyinstaller.org/).

### Updating gem
To upgrade I executed

    gem update --self

which resultet in an `ECONNREFUSED` error. Apparently it was the proxy, so I used

    set http_proxy=http://proxy:port

Executing the update command again worked just perfectly.

### Installing jekyll
As described on the install page, I used the gem command to install jekyll

    gem install jekyll

Result:

    Fetching: liquid-2.4.1.gem (100%)
    Fetching: fast-stemmer-1.0.1.gem (100%)
    ERROR:  Error installing jekyll:
            The 'fast-stemmer' native gem requires installed build tools.

    Please update your PATH to include build tools or download the DevKit
    from 'http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads' and follow the instructions
    at 'http://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit'

-.- Should have read the install guidelines in more details :P. Apparently I have to install the [development](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/development-kit) kit on Windows.

### Installing the Ruby dev kit
Plz just follow the instructions on [Github](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/development-kit).
After its installation again execute the Jekyll installation command which now should work properly.

## Jekyll Usage
Again, the main docs are [here](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/usage).
