I previously wrote about [my Sublime Text setup](/blog/2013/04/my-sublimetext-setup/). Well, Tuts+ has published a quite nice Sublime Text tutorial showing most of Sublime's features. Regardless of whether you're a Sublime Text enthusiast or not, you should definitely take a look at the tutorial.

The different single sessions are available directly at Tuts+ site: [https://tutsplus.com/course/improve-workflow-in-sublime-text-2/](https://tutsplus.com/course/improve-workflow-in-sublime-text-2/).

The tutorial covers all of the aspects I could think of or which I encountered in using Sublime so far, like:

- Multiple Cursors
- Fuzzy Search
- Command Palette
- Package Control
- Code Snippets
- Essential Plugins (like Emmet for Zen Coding, Sublime Linter, Live Reload,...)
- (much more)...

If you prefer to watch the video in its full length (~ 2 1/2 hours), then there's also the full video available on Youtube:
