## Talk Notes

- leadership
- bottleneck
- asked to create framework, do not create it, teach them how to do it s.t. they get more independent

Create self-organizing team, you're not going to get fired if you team them to "not need you":

> By growing others to not need you, you will always be wanted, appreciated and highly valuable.

### Leadership is tough

- "I want it to solve it yourself" -> I'm not doing my job => wrong, you teach them how to do it s.t. they get better
- coach them to learn, otherwise they'll always come back to you and ask for that solution

### How to grow people

- periods of slow learning, then periods of very quick learning
- "Ravines before Fast Growth": unlearn what he knew before -> difficult period, but once he knews the new way he got extremely more productive  
  - when switching programming language: initially stupid, but then you have different kind of patterns, different viewpoints which make you more productive; teach you to think about a problem differently
- "To grow the team, we must first realize we can do this ourselves." => start mentoring others to learn self; coaching might be uncomfortable;

### Time

- Others will do the task much slower than myself
- "Make time"
- Currently in "survivor mode" (not time to TDD, never time to do unit testing,...) -> you'll never have time 'cause bugs will introduce, take time...
- "learning mode": having enough time to practice things and actually using that time to learn -> you're the coach; if needed remove commitments; just sending devs to a 2 day unit test course and giving them 10% more time won't change anything. Things will  get even more slower, maybe double...
- "self-organizing mode"

### Triangle of Quality: only pick 2. Goal, have all 3 (obviously). Make devs doing code reviews of each other
- Sometimes people don't know that they don't know it.
- How do we lose quality?
  - 1) Write tests, or get it done? Answer: Let it fix quickly and get the thing done. Feeling = good
  - 2) Another thing happening? Again, write tests or get done?? Last time? -> fix quickly -> so continue that way; Feeling = good
  - Result: year later: code sucks
- don't argue with people which are doing the job: "The project is going to take 3 weeks without unit tests and 4 with unit tests". There's **no** choice, developing is done by writing unit tests, therefore they have to be written. (Car 20000 without wheels, 30000 with wheels); Stand up for the values you believe you're right

> For each behavior, The world is perfectly designed for that behavior to happen (Influencer - the power to change anything)

## Personal Comments

- See people creating frameworks and only let developers fill in the gaps
- failure, you won't have the time to fix those frameworks, instead, try to coach devs to get better, to understand. Otherwise they'll use the framework as "dumbs", and if something unexpected occurs, they have no chance of getting out as they don't know how the stuff they're using actually works (behind the scenes)
