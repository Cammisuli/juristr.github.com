One of the best moves I probably did about half a year ago was to move my Blog from blogger to Jekyll hosted on GitHub.
It simply reflects the kind of blogging experience you want as a dev with Markdown, full version control and amazing hosting on GitHub +
not to forget..Jekyll. Today I found a workflow: [Nitrious.IO](http://www.nitrious.io)

Jekyll is awesome as a blogging engine. You get an engine that allows to dynamically generate static pages: the best of both worlds! This allows
to have full control over the generated HTML code. Moreover Markdown editing is absolutely perfect for writing technical blog posts with lots of source code in it. 
There's nothing really I miss, except for..well you know when you're on another machine and you'd just like to quickly edit some post or even publish a new one, or when you'd like to use your tablet for finishing
that blog post...you **simply can't**. Why? Because Jekyll requires a working Ruby installation + if you have it hosted on GitHub (as I have) you need Git installed
as well. On a table that doesn't work.
