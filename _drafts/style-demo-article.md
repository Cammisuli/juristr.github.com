<p class="article-intro">
    I’ve noticed how seemingly small things like font and the spacing between letters can impact how I feel when reading online.
</p>
<h2>2. Pick a font size bigger than 12pt</h2>
<p>
    In 1929, a study <strong>was conducted</strong>
    called the “Hygiene of reading.” One thing researchers were trying to determine was which font size would be best for reading. The study looked at 6pt, 8pt, 10pt, 12pt, and 14pt type sizes.

    I had a moment of clarity. I realized the young man irrationally swearing at a box of tasteless japanese food must have it really, really good. If I can spend

<h3>Hi I am a h3 subtitle</h3>
<p>
    The researchers concluded that a font size of 10pt font is the most efficient for reading but a lot has changed in how we consume content today compared to the 1920s.

<p> <em>"Just to emphasize something..."</em>
</p>

<h4>Hi I am a h4 subtitle</h4>
<p>Let's add a code sample to see how it outlines.</p>
<div class="highlight">
    <pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt"><span class="tag">&lt;div</span></span><span class="pln"></span><span class="na"><span class="atn">ng-init</span><span class="pun">=</span></span><span class="s"><span class="atv">"text='Hello World'"</span></span><span class="nt"><span class="tag">&gt;</span></span><span class="pln"></span><span class="nt"><span class="tag">&lt;p&gt;</span></span><span class="pln">Value: {{ text }}</span><span class="nt"><span class="tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></span><span class="pln"></span><span class="nt"><span class="tag">&lt;/div&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>
    Inline
    <code>classes</code>
    are written as shown.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Figure out dates you can travel solo, preferably 1–2 weeks (assuming the less flexible work habits of an American)
    </li>
    <li>
        Pick a place or a few places you’ve never been before and don’t speak the local language. You may choose to stay the entirety of your traveling period in one city to maximize exposure or spend a few days in a couple of cities (e.g. Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, etc.) to broaden your exposure
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    However, as more reading shifts to digital and screen resolutions improve, the way we read content is changing.
</p>

<blockquote class="emphasized">I'm super emphasized!</blockquote>

<p>
    Many designers mention that 16px font is the new 12px font. A recent study has also shown that larger font sizes can elicit a stronger emotional connection.
