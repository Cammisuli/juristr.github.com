    We were so excited! Me and my girl have never been in the US before, and after having thought to visit the west coast already for a couple of years we finally decided <strong>to do it</strong>. Let's do a round-trip on the US west coast!
</div>

In this post we're documenting some of our experiences, to memorize and share them, and who knows, maybe it even helps some of you if you decide to do a similar trip as well :smiley:.

## The Planning

We started planning about half a year before, without any stress. First of all the date!

<blockquote class="emphasized">
    August 31, 2015 to September 21, 2015
    <br/>
    (3 awesome weeks!!)
</blockquote>

Once you have your date, make sure you get your flight booked. We already knew we wanted to pass by Los Angeles and San Francisco, so we looked for flights to one of those two destinations. The price might change based on where you're going to land. I also know of people going to Las Vegas and starting their trip from there.

We planned **for 3 weeks**. So what to visit? I mean, sure, you know about the big cities, L.A., S.F., Las Vegas, San Diego. But what else, which is a good route, what not to miss?? We started to crawl a ton of guides, read blogs, articles. That's one part, but somewhere you have to collect that information. I **absolutely love Trello**, so why not use it here as well?

_(Btw, my girl did choose the background color :unamused:)_

We used a shared folder on Dropbox for order confirmations and stuff.

That said, you can obviously store your planning wherever you're used to, but it's quite useful to have some common place, shareable with others, accessible from anywhere (especially on the mobile).

Once we had our major route, we had to distribute the major waypoints over the planned three weeks. **[Roadtrippers](https://roadtrippers.com) turned out to be a huge help with that**.

You may definitely want to check it out. You can add locations and associate a date with it. While we didn't book all of the hotels upfront, it is important to more or less know how much time you have and whether you'll be able to make it to visit everything you'd like to. My suggestion: don't put too much. After all it should be a holiday and relaxing rather than stressful :smiley:.

### How did you book the hotels?

We did only book the hotel for Los Angeles and San Francisco upfront. First of all because they tend to be quite costly, especially in San Francisco, and secondly because when you arrive at 5pm in L.A. you don't wanna go and search for a hotel.

We booked all the other hotels during our trip, usually the night before. Beside others we found the [Booking.com](https://booking.com) app to be quite useful. That worked quite well. But watch out, the part after [St. George](https://goo.gl/maps/8dnZteeB9fN2) to [Flagstaff](https://goo.gl/maps/eq2gmXpUEBG2) on our route tends to be more rural, with much fewer hotels, thus also more costly ones. There it might be convenient to book them upfront. We did that once we arrived to St. George from where we booked the hotels nearly till Flagstaff. Especially the part around [Page](https://goo.gl/maps/WVpzhrabhVr) tends to be very very costly with a bad price-quality ratio. So you may want to sleep somewhere else, either before or after visiting the sights around it.

> Generally speaking, it is much more convenient to stay for the night way before the major national parks. We usually stopped before s.t. the next morning we had an approx. 2 hours drive.

### A Car

You need a car! Obviously :smiley:. We used a German site [billiger-mietwagen.de](https://www.billiger-mietwagen.de/) to book it (in the end we got one from Alamo). We compared a couple of sites but none of them presented the information as clear as billiger-mietwagen.de.

Some advices when getting a car:

- don't get a too small one. You spend most of your time in the car after all.
- Insurance: make sure you have Collision Damage Waiver (CDW) and Theft Protection (TP) without any costs on your side. We also made a separate "road safe" insurance which you can only make the moment when getting the car.
- obviously, make sure it has a navigation system

## 1. Landing in Los Angeles

</a>

**31.08.-01.09. -** We arrived at about 5pm at L.A., after a 11 hour non-stop flight. We picked up the Alamo shuttle at the airport, fetched our car and went straight to our hotel: sleep deprivation!!

<div class="clear"></div>

Oh, btw, did I tell you which car we got?

A Dodge Durango. Massive car and it was huge, but we managed to fill it up :smiley:. The car rental guy proposed it to us, he for sure made some good money and we had lot of fun traveling with it. But yes..you definitely don't need such a huge one.

The **day after we decided to do breakfast** near the Santa Monica beach. We started at about 7:30am, but hadn't planned for the LA traffic.

At around 10:30am we arrived at our destination: Mr. Street Kitchen. And it was worth it :wink:.

After this quite "rich" breakfast (which also covered our lunch for that day), we drifted around the Santa Monica pier.

Our next stop: **Rodeo drive**. Luxury pure: Chanel, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Moncler, Prada...

Obviously we also couldn't miss the **walk of fame**...

..and finally, **Hollywood**.

    </a>
</figure>

That concluded our stay in Los Angeles. We only planned one day for visiting L.A. Having more time you could definitely visit more, like the different studios etc.

## 2. Traveling along the west coast to Monterey

    <img src="/blog/assets/imgs/us2015/02-monterey-map.png">
</a>

**02.09. -** We left L.A. in the early morning to avoid being stuck in the traffic. We followed the Sunset Blvd and drove by Beverly Hills till we reached the beach road, passing by Malibu Beach towards Santa Barbara.

<div class="clear"></div>

At Oxnard we quickly stopped to **buy our cooler** :smiley:. Some friends gave us this tip and it is an absolute must! Most of the hotels have some kind of ice machine. You buy  That way you can buy food and especially to drink in supermarkets and keep it in your car, without it going to get bad.
