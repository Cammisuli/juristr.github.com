This article aims at introducing you to some of the currently most popular tools when developing modern web applications with JavaScript. These are totally not new at all and have been around for a couple of years now. Still, if you didn't get into them already, this post might help you get started.

## Node and NPM

Node.js brings JavaScript to the server and the desktop. While initially JavaScript was mainly used as a browser based language, with Node you can now also create your server-side backend or even a [desktop application](http://strongloop.com/strongblog/creating-desktop-applications-with-node-webkit/) with [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit) (for the crazy ones among you).

> Node.jsÂ® is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices. <cite><a href="http://nodejs.org/">nodejs.org</a></cite>

A simple webserver

```javascript
var http = require('http');
http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
  res.end('Hello World\n');
}).listen(1337, '127.0.0.1');
console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:1337/');
```

To run the server:

```javascript
$ node start
Server running at http://172.0.0.1:1337/
```

One of the great things about node is its enourmous community which creates and publishes so-called **node modules** on the [NPM directory](https://www.npmjs.org/) (currently ~90.000 modules and ~390.000 downloads last month).

Besides creating server applications with Node, it has also become the **VM** for JavaScript development tools like minifiers, code linters etc. Both, Grunt and Yeoman (described in this article) are based upon Node's infrastructure.

More on [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/) and [npmjs.org](http://www.npmjs.org).

### Installing node packages

Installing a node package is as simple as executing:

```
$ npm install grunt
```

This installs the grunt node package into a folder called `node_modules`.

![Demo: installation of a node  module](/blog/assets/imgs/node-grunt-yeoman/node-module-install-demo.gif)

The best practices approach though is to create a `package.json` file. Since the suggested approach is to not commit the content of your `node_modules` folder to your VCS, but rather to automatically reinstall them during the build process, you need a place to keep track about the installed package and its according version: `package.json`.

To create a new `package.json`, simply execute `npm init` inside a clean folder. You'll have to answer a few questions but ultimately ou will get a nice new package config file.

![Example of a package.json file](/blog/assets/imgs/node-grunt-yeoman/package-json.png)

Whenever you install new packages use the `--save` or `--save-dev` option to persist the package into the `package.json` file.

```
$ npm install --save-dev grunt
```

This automatically adds `grunt` to the `devDependencies` section of the package config file:

```json
{
  ...
  "devDependencies": {
    "grunt": "^0.4.5"
  }
}
```

Similarly, if you add `--save` it'll be added to the `dependencies` section. The difference is mainly that `dependencies` are actively used by your appliation and should be deployed together with it. `devDependencies` are tools you use during the development of the application but they normally do not require to be deployed (i.e. code minifier scripts etc.).  
To **uninstall** use..

```
$ npm uninstall --save-dev grunt
```

..which uninstalls `grunt` and removes it from the `package.json` as well.

### Restoring packages

As I mentioned, you normally don't commit the `node_modules` folder to your VCS. Thus, when you as a dev or the buildserver retrieves the source code, the packages need to be restored somehow. By having a `package.json` file this is simply done executing

```
$ npm init
```

NPM takes the dependencies stored in package config file and retrieves them in the exact version you specified.

### Versioning

NPM packages use [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). 

<blockquote>
  <p>Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,</li>
    <li>MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and</li>
    <li>PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.</li>
  </ul>
  <cite><a href="http://semver.org/">http://semver.org/</a></cite>
</blockquote>

Each package inside `package.json` is listed with its according version and upgrade behavior. You can have the following schemes:

- `1.3.5`:  
tells npm to just use the given version (most restrictive).
- `~1.3.5` or `1.3.x`:  
tells npm to only upgrade the given package for increments of the patch version (normally just bugfixes). NPM defines it as `~1.2.3 := >=1.2.3-0 <1.3.0-0`.
- `^1.3.5`:  
tells npm it can upgrade to any version < `2.0.0`. This is the new default behavior when you install node packages (before it was `~`). NPM defines it as `1.2.3 := >=1.2.3-0 <2.0.0-0`.
- `latest` or `*`:  
tells npm to always update to the latest version (not recommended)

## Yeoman

Yeoman has become the standard scaffolding toolkit for creating modern JavaScript applications.

![](/blog/assets/imgs/node-grunt-yeoman/yeoman-logo.png)

Yeoman is build around **generators** which are either developed by the Yeoman team ([official generators](http://yeoman.io/generators/official.html)) or by the [open source community](http://yeoman.io/generators/community.html). Yeoman itself basically just provides the infrastructure for building and running those generators.

> Yeoman helps you kickstart new projects, prescribing best practices and tools to help you stay productive. <cite>From the <a href="http://yeoman.io/">official site</a></cite>

What's nice about such approach is

- that you can quickly get up to speed. Creating a project setup with proper tools and dev support can cost you lots of time and requires expert knowledge.
- that you don't necessarly have to know all the best practices tools that are currently available on the market. Yeoman assembles them for you to get started. Then once you get more expert you can adjust them to your project needs
- that you learn lots and lots of new tools.

Yeoman is distributed as a node module. Simply install it globally

```
$ npm install -g yo
```

Then find your generator (i.e. [for angular](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)), install it...

```
$ npm install -g generator-angular
```

and then execute it within your project directory to create a new app.

```
$ yo angular [app-name]
```

This will create the initial scaffold from which you can then start building your app. But Yeoman goes futher, based on the generator you use, you may also generate single components, like Angular controllers, directives etc. while you develop.

```
$ yo angular:controller user
```

That's all regarding Yeoman's usage. More advanced topics are about creating your own custom generator. Simply [study the docs](http://yeoman.io/authoring/), they're quite detailed.

## Grunt

Grunt is **automation**. It is a task-based command line build tool for JavaScript projects. The official headline: "The JavaScript Task Runner".

![](/blog/assets/imgs/node-grunt-yeoman/grunt-logo.jpeg)

To get started, simply follow the [online guide on the official site](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started). There's also a great book [Getting Started with Grunt - The JavaScript Task Runner](http://www.packtpub.com/web-development/getting-started-grunt-javascript-task-runner) published by PacktPub which is ideal for beginners.


### Installation

Grunt runs on top of Node.js platform and is distributed through the npm repository. It comes as two different tools

- `grunt-cli` which is the **Grunt Command-line interface**
- `grunt` module

The reason for having two components is to make sure we can run different grunt versions side-by-side (i.e. legacy versions in older projects). Hence, `grunt-cli` is installed globally while `grunt` is installed on a per-project basis.

```
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Then enter the project where you wish to use Grunt and execute

```
$ npm install grunt
```

### Gruntfile.js

The `Gruntfile.js` is the place where you configure the Grunt tasks for your project. It starts as simple as this file:

```javascript
module.exports = function(grunt) {
  // Do grunt-related things in here
};
```

The `grunt` object is Grunt's **API**: [http://gruntjs.com/api/grunt](http://gruntjs.com/api/grunt).

### Grunt modules

Grunt modules are distributed through Node's NPM directory. Normally, Grunt specific modules are prefixed with `grunt-` and official grunt plugins are prefixed `grunt-contrib`. Example: `grunt-contrib-uglify`.

Hence, Grunt modules are node modules and thus you install them just as you normally would

```
$ npm install --save-dev grunt-contrib-uglify
```

To use external Grunt tasks in your `Gruntfile` you first have to load them. This is done by using the `loadNpmTasks` on the `grunt` object.

```javascript
module.exports = function(grunt){
  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-concat');
  ...
}
```

<p class="notice tip">
  In order not having to do this for every single task you use (which can be quite a lot), you may want to use the <code>load-grunt-tasks</code> plugin and execute <code>require('load-grunt-tasks')(grunt)</code> at the beginning of your Gruntfile.js. This will autoload all grunt modules, ready to be used.
</p>

### Anatomy of Grunt tasks

You normally start by defining the build tasks like this example of a `stringCheck` task taken from the Grunt book I mentioned before.

```javascript
module.exports = function(grunt){
  ...
  grunt.initConfig({
    stringCheck: {
      file: './src/somefile.js',
      string: 'console.log('
    }
  });
}
```

In the end, a Grunt task is simply a function that you register with Grunt.

```javascript
module.exports = function(grunt){
  grunt.registerTask('stringCheck', function() {
    //fail if configuration is not provided
    grunt.config.requires('stringCheck.file');
    grunt.config.requires('stringCheck.string');
    
    //retrieve filename and load it
    var file = grunt.config('stringCheck.file');
    var contents = grunt.file.read(file);
    
    //retrieve string to search for
    var string = grunt.config('stringCheck.string');
    
    if(contents.indexOf(string >= 0))
      grunt.fail.warn('"' + string + '" found in "' + file + '"');
    });
}
```

### Multitasks

Grunt also allows you to group a task execution.

```javascript
module.exports = function(grunt){
  ...
  grunt.initConfig({
    stringCheck: {
      target1: {
        file: './src/somefile.js',
        string: 'console.log('
      },
      target2: {
        file: './src/somefile.js',
        string: 'eval('
      }      
    }
  });
}
```

These can then be executed with `grunt stringCheck:target1` and `runt stringCheck:target2`. `target1` and `target2` can obviously be named differently.

### Globbing

File globbing or wildcard matching is a way to capture a large group of files with a single expression rather than listing all of them individually which is often not even possible. From [the official docs](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks#globbing-patterns):

- `*` matches any number of characters, but not `/`
- `?` matches a single character, but not `/`
- `**` matches any number of characters, including `/`, as long as it's the only thing in a path part
- `{}` allows for a comma-separated list of "or" expressions 
- `!` at the beginning of a pattern will negate the match

`All` most people need to know is that `foo/*.js` will match all files ending with `.js` in the `foo/` subdirectory, but `foo/**/*.js` will match all files ending with `.js` in the `foo/` _subdirectory and all of its subdirectories_.

Since most of the tasks ultimately interact with the file system, Grunt already predisposes a structure to make task devs' life easier. If a globbing expession is specified, Grunt tries to match it against the file system and places all matches in the `this.files` array.  
Hence, you will see a lot of tasks having a syntax like

```javascript
target1: {
  src: ['src/a.js', 'src/b.js']
}
```

or

```javascript
target1: {
  src: `src/{a,b}.js`,
  dest: `dest/ab.js`
}
```

It is also possible to define multiple source sets with according destination. For this purpose the `files` array is used.

```javascript
target1: {
  files: [
    { src: 'src/{a,b,c}.js', dest: 'dest/abc.js' },
    { src: 'src/{x,y,z}.js', dest: 'dest/xyz.js' }
  ]
}
```

The following, more compact, object notation is equivalent

```javascript
target1: {
  files: {
    'dest/abc.js': 'src/{a,b,c}.js',
    'dest/xyz.js': 'src/{x,y,z}.js'
  }
}
```
Another common task is to copy a set of files to a given directory (for example with preprocessors like SASS or CoffeeScript compilers). Instead of providing the single src and dest instructions we can use the following syntax:

```javascript
target2: {
  files: [
    {
      expand: true,
      cwd: 'lib/',
      src: '**/*.js',
      dest: 'build/',
      ext: '.min.js'
    }, 
  ],
}
```

The expand property tells Grunt to generate a corresponding destination for each matched file. `cwd` stands for the current working directory, `src` and `dest` are self explanatory and `ext` is the extension to be used for the destination files. More options can be found [in the official docs](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks).

### Running tasks

Ultimately your goal is to execute the Grunt tasks you defined. If you remember, you previously installed the `grunt-cli` tool globally which you can now use to run a task.

```
$ grunt task1 task2
```

If you have a multitarget task, then use `:` to specify it.

```
$ grunt task:target1
```

If you run `$ grunt` instead, the **default task** will be executed which you can configure as follows:

```javascript
module.exports = function(grunt) {
  grunt.registerTask('build', function() {
    console.log('building...');
  });

  grunt.registerTask('test', function() {
    console.log('testing...');
  });
  
  grunt.registerTask('default', ['build', 'test']);
};
```

Having this `Gruntfile.js` configuration executes `build` and `test` when you type `grunt` into your console.
