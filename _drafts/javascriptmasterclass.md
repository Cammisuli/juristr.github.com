Continuous improvement is an important concept. Everyone wants to get better, to learn new things. This is vital, especially in the software industry where things move at an extremely fast pace. In the video below (from JSConf US), Angelina Fabbor explains what's most important to advance from a beginner to an intermediate and to ultimately become an expert.

The slides are available [here](http://afabbro.github.io/jsconf2013/).

Below I outlined some of the key points mentioned in the talk.

## How do you know you're not a beginner?

1. **You can use fundamentals**  
   (loops, if-else, variables, operators,...)  
   You should basically be able to get out a hello world or small app.
1. **Comfortable writing code from scratch**  
   Composing different jQuery plugins is not programming
1. **You're curious to know how something work**  
   For instance you start reading an existing jQuery plugin's code
1. **You feel your code is mediocre**  


## How do you know you're not an expert?

1. **You don't quite rock all the code you read**  
   You get into the jQuery source, but you don't really understand all the comments...  
1. **You can't explain what you know**  
   Lots of devs are brilliant and write awesome code, but you can't explain what you know to someone else in a patient way.
1. **You aren't confident debugging**  
   You still use `console.log` or `response.writeln` statements instead...
1. **You rely on references too much**  
   You continuously have to lookup stuff in references (i.e. MSDN docs, Javadocs,...). It's not bad "per se" but you'll get faster if you not have to, obviously :)

## What makes a great programmer

### depends who's asking

It really depends who is asking. For a customer it is the developer which can deliver 

### What do you need to learn

1. **Ask why obsessively**  
   Know what's behind. "Why did I choose Bootstrap?"
1. **Teach and/or speak at an event**  
   Tell people, share knowledge. This way you need to formalize your ideas, make them more concrete. Reflecting makes you learn a lot.
1. **Work through a suggested curriculum (books)**
   For instance Jon Resig's ["Learning advanced JavaScript"](http://ejohn.org/apps/learn/).
1. **Experiment Recklessly**  
   "Do silly things just to see what happens"
1. **Have opinions**  
   But respect other people's opinions! Accept that you could be wrong -> hence learn again
1. **Seek mentorship**  
   Being able to discuss ideas/problems without fear.
1. **Program a lot**
1. **Stop fucking programming somethings**
   You need breaks!!
1. **Write JavaScript a lot**
1. **Write in another language for a while**  
   Compare with other languages. Find nuances, exercise your brain, get different, fresh viewpoints,...
1. **Think like a programmer when AFK**
1. **Know what good feedback is and reject all else**  
   Turns out some people aren't really happy with themselves and they'll take it out on you
1. **Fall in love with your process**
