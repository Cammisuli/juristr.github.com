<p class="article-intro">
    In this article I'm going to take a look at some Angular 2 starter projects.
</p>

{% include postads %}

I was able to identify the following main starter projects

- Angular 2 CLI generated project
- [angular2-seed](https://github.com/mgechev/angular2-seed) is a
 SystemJS based setup by Minko Gechev
- [angular2-webpack-starter](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter) by AngularClass based on Webpack

## angular2-seed

**GitHub:** [https://github.com/mgechev/angular2-seed](https://github.com/mgechev/angular2-seed)

Like

- generates docs out of your project (like a JavaDoc for TypeScript and Angular components)
- Based on SystemJS

Dislike

- lots of configuration, bloated and hard to understand

## angular2-webpack-starter

**GitHub:** [https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter)

Like

- seems lightweight
