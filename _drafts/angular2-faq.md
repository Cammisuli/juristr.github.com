## FAQs

#### Where do I get started?

[angular.io](https://angular.io/) is the site to go. It's the official web site for Angular 2 and has lots of articles and tutorials, lots of them even written directly by core community contributors.

#### How should I structure my app?

First of all, take a look at the [Angular 1 style guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide). Even if it is for Angular 1, it has some good concepts on structuring your app. Here are some further tips:

- Create separate modules where each is as independent as possible.
- One responsibility per file
