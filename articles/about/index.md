title: "About this site"

Welcome, you're in the "articles area" of my site. The reason for having a dedicated area for [posts on my blog](/blog) and [articles](/articles) is that I think they belong to two different categories:

- **blog:** you comment on something you've read or just broadcast some findings. Usually they are short, informative pieces of text.
- **article:** something more evolved, a guide about some specific topic, a step-by-step tutorial, something that might get updated like a wiki (perhaps)...

I just wanted to give it a try and see how it evolves. Some of the articles might be fully fledged from the very beginning, while others might be forming themselves over time as I study something and hence get updated like a Wiki.

## About creating this site

This site was created with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) as IMHO it is the easiest and most flexible way of creating sites (especially if you know to code).  
The layout is not mine, at least not the base of it. I have taken it from the HTML5Rocks site (see credits and GitHub link in the footer), adapted and ported it to Jekyll. I'll work to standardize it further and release it back to the community as a reusable Jekyll template s.t. also others can benefit.
