title: "About this site"

Welcome, you're in the "articles area" of my site. The reason for having a dedicated area for [posts on my blog](/blog) and [articles](/articles) is that I think they belong to two different categories:

- **blog:** you comment on something you've read or just broadcast some findings. Usually they are short, informative pieces of text.
- **article:** something more evolved, a guide about some specific topic, a step-by-step tutorial, something that might get updated like a wiki (perhaps)...

I just wanted to give it a try and see how it evolves. Some of the articles might be fully fledged from the very beginning, while others might be forming themselves over time as I study something and hence get updated like a Wiki.

## About creating this site

This site was created with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) as IMHO it is the easiest and most flexible way of creating sites (especially if you know to code).  
The layout is not mine, at least not the base of it. I have taken it from the [HTML5Rocks](http://www.html5rocks.com) site (see credits and GitHub link in the footer), adapted and ported it to Jekyll. Everything is hosted by GitHub and GitHub Pages which. As such, the deployment process is as simple as writing the article with Markdown and to push it to GitHub which will process and publish it.

## Open source

And obviously, Open Source. By living on GitHub you can see the entire source of the articles as well as the Jekyll layout and structure. In fact, if you want to **contribute**, either correcting something wrong or by adding missing stuff, you can do so, by simply forking the repository and submitting a pull request. GitHub makes this especially easy in that you can just click the edit link on the repository file and it will do the forking for you. To make it even more convenient, I include appropriate links on each article header which allow you to **edit by forking**, to **see the version history** or to file an **issue** (like an idea or correction proposal).

The next step will be to give something back to the community by creating a standardized Jekyll template which can be seamlessly used by everyone. While I designed this articles section to be able to live by its own, there are still some parts that are quite integrated with my blog's Jekyll layout. Thus there is some standardization work to be done before I'll push everything on it's own GitHub repo.
