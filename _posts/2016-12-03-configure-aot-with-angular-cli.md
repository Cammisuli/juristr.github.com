  In <a href="/blog/2016/10/lets-create-ur-first-ng2-app/" target="_blank">our previous video</a> we learned how to use the <a href="" target="_blank">Angular CLI</a> to create our first Angular application. Now it's time to prepare it for production. That requires some building, bundling, minifying and "Ahead of Time" compilation. In this video we will learn how simple it can be by using the Angular CLI.

> **TL;DW (Too long, didn't watch):** You can simply append the `--aot` to your build instruction, like `ng build --prod --aot`. Ya, it's really that damn simple :smiley: 


This video you will learn about...

- how to use the Angular CLI to create a production bundle
- what Ahead-of-time (AoT) compilation is about
