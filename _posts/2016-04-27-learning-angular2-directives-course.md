<div class="article-intro">
    Finally :satisfied:, I managed to finish and publish <strong>my very first video course: "Learning Angular 2 Directives"</strong> by Packt Publishing. So relieved, and I even managed to publish it before the official RC1 :wink:. Interested? Then read on for getting an overview on what it is all about!

Well, as the title says, this video course **focuses on the core part of Angular 2, directives and components**, the latter actually being a specialization of a directive. Ya, that's also something you'll learn in the course :wink:).  
During the entire course we will basically like pair program a sample application, which we'll use to discover and learn the new concepts behind Angular 2.

<em><strong>TL;DR:</strong> head over [to the official page](https://goo.gl/iJKPUi)</em>

Ok, so I don't want to bore you too much as you can [read up the entire description on the official video course website](https://goo.gl/iJKPUi), but just a quick glance of what you can expect.

The course basically starts of by **giving you an introduction to the modern tooling**. We'll explore some of the new and most important ES2015 (formerly known as ES6) concepts and create a setup with TypeScript and SystemJS. You will then learn about **the concept of components and web components**, something that is nowadays common for all the big player front-end frameworks such as React, Ember, angular and obviously the more pure implementations like Polymer. From section to section we will then discover new concepts around Angular 2 components, data flow, events, [styling](/blog/2016/01/learning-ng2-dynamic-styles/), [content projection](/blog/2016/01/ng2-multi-content-projection/) etc. Besides that, we also cover unit testing, debugging and end-to-end testing, which I summarized under the chapter **maintaining components**. Finally, some more "fancy" stuff as we'll demo **Angular 2 running on the mobile with Ionic 2** and **Angular on the server with Angular Universal**.

#### So, you will learn to..

- Develop a strong understanding of Angular 2 components by slicing static HTML pages into dedicated components
- Configure a modern setup with TypeScript, SystemJS, and ES2015
- Refactor and upgrade an Angular 1.x application to Angular 2
- Design reusable components by understanding how data flows in and out of them and by leveraging advanced Angular 2 template techniques
- Debug Angular 2 components and write automated unit and end-to-end tests
- Embed external libraries such as d3 
- Run Angular 2 components on mobile devices and on the server

#### Motivated?

Great :smiley:. So head over to Packt Pub and grab your copy :wink:

#### Thanks!

Many thanks to my girl which gave me all the support I could imagine during this quite intense phase of producing this video course.  
Also, thanks to [Nathan Walker](https://twitter.com/wwwalkerrun) for doing the tech review. I'm so glad I had him on board as he's such an active and valuable Angular community member right now :+1:.
