I'm lucky enough to be able to attend [AngularConnect](http://angularconnect.com/) here at London. This article is going to be my notebook while attending the conference. So expect it to be quite rough initially. I'll then update and refine it after the conf. You might also want to check out my [refined notes from day 1](/blog/2015/10/angular-connect-london/).

<div class="alert alert-info">
    This is what I call a <strong>living article</strong> as I'm going to continuously update it during my stay here at the conference. So check back during the next days as more stuff flows in :)
