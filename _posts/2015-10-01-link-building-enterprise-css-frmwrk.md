I've already had a couple of times the chance to work on a common style guide for our enterprise-wide web applications. It **really is tough**. Not only in coming up with a standard that meet the need of most of our apps, but especially in documenting, maintaining and letting evolve it over time.

The people from Salesforce seem to have done a really really nice job: [Lightning Design System](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/)

## Some notes

- have a living style guide
- design system of patterns, CSS + markup samples, icons, custom fonts, color swatches etc...
- resources used equally by internal devs as well as external partners (huge :thumbsup: )
- 4 design principles: clarity, efficiency, consistency, beauty
- Clarity
  - prefer verbose class names for the sake of saving bits
  - adopted [BEM naming](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/).
  - documentation
  - living example, you can interact with (i.e.) the button, hover it, click it..
- Efficiency
