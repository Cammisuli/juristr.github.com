## Introduction

### Framework JavaScript
(specific examples of existing frameworks, like Backbone, Ember,...)

### JavaScriptMVC
JavaScriptMVC is a full-stack JavaScript frameworks composed of components for code generation, testing, a class library, jQuery events, building and linting. The standard JMVC structure looks as follows:

- documentjs _- the documentation engine_
- funcunit _- the unit and functional unit testing components_
- jquery _- jQuery, class library, models,etc..the core of the framework_
- steal _- dependency manager_

JavaScriptMVC is heavily organized around conventions and the MVC concept. Every so-called JavaScriptMVC app or widget is structured in a folder having the name of the widget with a corresponding `widgetname.js` file. Consider a widget _person_, the structure would look like:

    person
        person.js
        
The `person.js` file is the main entry point of the widget. This structure reflects throughout the whole JMVC framework itself.

### MVC and JavaScriptMVC
The Model-View-Controller pattern is a common UI-pattern for realizing a clean separation of concerns. The responsibilies are organized as follows:

- **controller** - The controller is the _coordinator_ between the view and the model. It is responsible for intercepting events, loading the required model and for passing the according model data to the right view. For this purpose, controllers are being _attached to a DOM_ element.
- **model** - The model is responsible for handling everything that is related to the data. They contain the necessary logic for interacting the the server-side counterpart as well as for mapping/converting the data as needed. Models _should not_ contain any application state, but just data.
- **view** - The view is responsible for rendering the model data as HTML which is then usually taken by the controller and inserted in the DOM.

JMVC strictly follows this pattern by organizing the application in a

- controllers
- models and
- views

folder. The **controller** files are named with a `_controller` suffix, like

- controllers
    - person_controller.js
    - main_controller.js

A typical controller is structured as follows:

    $.Controller.extend('Demoapp.Controllers.Person', 
    {
        /* @static */
        
        aStaticFunction: function(){
            console.log("I'm a static function");
        }
    },
    {
        /* @prototype */
        
        anInstanceFunction: function(){
            console.log("I'm an instance function");
        }
        
    });

As can be seen, there is a static part which can be invoked directly on the controller, without the need for the instance, contrary to the "instance" part. `aStaticFunction` can be invoked as

    Demoapp.Controllers.Person.aStaticFunction();
    
while the instance function `anInstanceFunction` is invoked as

    var controller = new Demoapp.Controllers.Person($("#main"));
    controller.anInstanceFunction();
    
As can be seen, by default the 1st parameter of the controller is the DOM element it is being bound to. There esists also a 2nd way of instantiating a controller which is more jQuery-like:

    $("#main").demoapp_person();
    
This would have the same effect as the example before, namely attaching a new instance of the controller to the DOM element. The syntax here is `<appname>_<controllername>`. For then again retrieving an instance of the controller from a DOM element one can use

    $("#main").controller(); //retrieve 1 controller
    $("#main").controllers(); //retrieve a set of controllers, if there are multiple ones attached

Each of these controllers has an associated **view** in a folder matching the controller's name. The detail and edit view of a person controller would be placed in a folder `person`as shown below:

- views
    - person
        - detail.ejs
        - edit.ejs
        
JMVC uses the [EJS (Embedded JS)](http://embeddedjs.com/) templating engine. The syntax of the template might look familiar to the classical ASP one, for instance:

    <div>
        Hi, <%~ this.name %>!
    </div>
    
The `~` is used in order to encode the value to prevent script injection. The only exception to use `<%= %>` is for numeric values.

## Developing a JavaScriptMVC app
This chapter describes the development of a small JavaScriptMVC application, explaining different kind of concepts thoughout its development.

### Objective
The objective is to develop a mini-app called "Demoapp" which is working upon the concept of a "Person", implementing the following basic functionalities:

- a **filter** which allows to search for a specific person given the firstname, lastname age etc... which then displays the result in a list
- a **detail view** of a specific person starting from the filter page showing basically all available data for a person
- an **edit view** for editing an existing person
- a **creation view** for creating a new person
- **deleting** an existing person

Furthermore the implementation should have

- a validation of the input fields
- date pickers where necessary
- information messages in order to notify the user about events that are happening
- user authentication and authorization management.

### Generating the App
The first step in creating a JavaScriptMVC application is to copy the necessary source files to the working directory. Normally this source folder has the following structure:

- frontend
	- documentjs
	- funcunit
	- jquery
	- siag
	- steal

Once that step is done it's time to generate the first app using the command

	js.bat siag\generate\app demoapp

executed from within the frontend folder. As a result, a new folder will be added named "Demoapp" which is basically the name of our application.

### App Setup Overview
The internal structure of the generated application reflects the one imposed by JavaScriptMVC, namely

- **demoapp**
	- **controllers** - _the folder where the controllers reside_
	- **css** - _the application css_
	- **i18n** - _the localization files_
	- **models** - _the models_
	- **resources** - _eventual external resources, like jQuery plugins, images etc..._
	- **test** - _QUnit unit tests_
	- **views** - _the application views_
	- config.js - _the app configuration file_
	- demoapp.js - _the app startup file_
	- index.html - _the app startup HTML_
	- menu.json - _the app menu_
	- production.cmd - _the "compilation" script_
	- production.html - _the production html file_
	- unittests.html - _the html file for starting the qunit tests_

**index.html**  
The initial file that gets loaded by the browser is the `index.html` file. This file contains the basic HTML skeleton of the application with an important line towards the end:

	<script type='text/javascript' src='../steal/steal.js?demoapp,development'></script>

This is the **only** script that gets included and which is responsible for loading the demoapp application.

**demoapp.js**  
This is the main entry point of the application which gets loaded first. Lets take a look at the structure in more details:

	steal.plugins(	
		'jquery/controller',			// a widget factory
		'jquery/controller/subscribe',	// subscribe to OpenAjax.hub
		'jquery/view/ejs',				// client side templates
		'jquery/controller/view',		// lookup views with the controller's name
		'jquery/model',					// Ajax wrappers
		'jquery/dom/fixture',			// simulated Ajax requests
		'jquery/dom/form_params',		// form data helper
		//'siag/bn',					// Citizen portal site scripts
		//'siag/userwidget',			// User authentication widget (for IAM)
		'siag')							// siag plugins
		
		.css('css/style')				// loads styles
	
		.resources()					// 3rd party script's (like jQueryUI), in resources folder
	
		.models('greetings')			// loads files in models folder 
	
		.controllers('main', 'demoapp')	// loads files in controllers folder
	
		.views()						// adds views to be added to build
		
		.then(function () {
			//...
		});

This first part of the file does nothing else than instructing **steal** (JavaScriptMVC's dependency loader) to load the required files for the application to work correctly. The part where it includes `siag` is nothing else than an instruction to load the `siag.js` from the `siag` folder. This basically loads the JavaScript files that have been developed internally in SIAG, containing a set of utilities useful during the development of JMVC apps.  
The remaining instructions are quite intuitive, namely 

- `.css` loads the corresponding CSS stylesheets
- `.resources` is meant to include external JavaScript libraries such as additional jQuery plugins
- `.models` includes the application models
- `.controllers` includes the application controllers
- `.views` contains all the views that should be included in the final production build rather than loaded at demand (which is the default behavior). Note that here it is necessary to include the full path of the view, i.e. `\\demoapp\views\person\edit.ejs`.

The next point is the

	.then(function (){
		//....
	}

part which is basically the point where the application logic starts. We will come back to this at a later point.

**config.js**  
The config.js file is basically the application configuration file. It may contain global flag settings which are then consumed by the application. Often there might also be a separate config.js file for each deploy environment, like `config-production.js`. During the deploy process this file is then deployed as `config.js` to the webserver. The `demoapp.js` file then loads this configuration as follows

	$.get('config.js').complete(function() {
		//....
	}

This happens right as one of the first instructions during the application startup.

**menu.json**  
This file contains the application's menu structure as a JSON document. For example

	{"menu":
		[
		 	{
		 		"id": "home",
		 		"title": "Go back home",
		 		"text": "Home",
		 		"href": "#demoapp"
		 	},
		 	{
		 		"title": "Example menu",
		 		"submenu": [
					{"title": "Submenu 1"}, 
					{"title": "Submenu 2"}
				]
		 	}
		]
	}

The loading of the menu normally happens inside the `demoapp.js` by using the Siag menu plugin as follows:

	$("#udm").siag_menu();

**production.cmd**  
This is a utility batch script which fires up the compilation process of the application and is responsible for copying the application in a _deploy-ready_ state to the _production_ folder inside the application.

**production.html**  
The production.html file is basically the same as the index.html file with the difference that it is meant to be used in a production environment. Hence, it doesn't load the application in development mode but in production mode which is given by the following instruction at the end of the HTML file.

	<script type='text/javascript' src='steal.production.js?./production.js'></script>


### The Application Controller and Routing
When the application starts up, you'll find an instruction inside the `demoapp.js` which looks like the following:

	$("body").demoapp_main();

As by the specification of a JMVC controller, this instruction means the attaching of the `main_controller.js` onto the DOM's `body` element. Lets look in more detail about its inner workings:

	$.Controller.extend('Demoapp.Controllers.Main',
	{
	    defaults: {
	        element: '#main'
	    }
	},
	{
		init: function() {
			
		},
		
	    'history.** subscribe': function (called, data) {
	        //redirect somewhere if no hash is present
	        var that = this;
	    	if (window.location.hash === '') {
				that.redirectTo({controller: 'demoapp'});
			} else {
	            //just execute the normal routing procedure
	      		Siag.Route.invokeRoute(this, called, data);
			}
	    }
	});
	
The code above represents the default implementation of the `main_controller.js` which is automatically generated by the JMVC scaffolder. 

The main point of interest is the following part:

	'history.** subscribe': function (called, data) {
		//...
	}

This is basically the instruction to **subscribe to all history events** for realizing the application's routing functionality. History events get fired whenever the hash of the url changes, like a changes

- `index.html` -> `index.html#home`
- `index.html#home` -> `index.html#home/detail`
- `index.html#home/detail` -> `index.html#home/edit&id=1`

For each of these calls the function above gets invoked. Lets take the example of `index.html#home/edit&id=1`. Such URL would call the function with the params

- called: "history.home.edit" and
- data: `{ id: "1" }`

By invoking `Siag.Route.invokeRoute(this, called, data)` on the siag routing plugin (which can be found under `frontend\siag\route`} it will automatically instantiate the corresponding controller with the name `home_controller.js` and invoke the function `edit` passing in as parameter an object `{ id: "1" }`.  
By default all these controllers are automatically attached to the `#main` DOM element of the HTML page. This can be changed by changing the according property in the `main_controller.js`:

	defaults: {
		element: '#main'
	}


### The Person Controller
One of the first steps when implementing the required functionalities is to **create a new controller** named `person_controller.js` right in the folder `controllers` of our demoapp.

The initial code is minimal and will probably look as follows:

	$.Controller.extend('Demoapp.Controllers.Person',
	{/* static */},
	{/* prototype */
	
	    //constructor
	    init: function(element){

	    }
	
	});

It is worth noting that the controller's `init` function  accepts additional parameters, however the first one is _always_ the element the controller is bound to which is accessible through `this.elmement` in the entire controller code.
The next step is to **register the controller** on our application s.t. it knows about it. This is done in the `demoapp.js` file:

	.controllers(
        'main', 
        'demoapp',
		'person'
    )

When now reloading the app it should correctly recognize our person controller. This can be easily verified by launching the Chrome Devtools (or Firebug) and typing in the full name of our controller and see whether it is being recognized correctly:

![](./resources/controller_loading_devtools.png)

### Implementing the Filter Functionality
One of the first functionalities we're going to realize is the filter or search functionality. For this purpose we create a `filter` action in our person controller which will be invoked by the routing:

	$.Controller.extend('Demoapp.Controllers.Person',
	{ /*static */},
	{
		//...
		
		//publics

		filter: function(){
			console.log("Yea, calling filter worked");
		}
	})

Reloading the app and calling `index.html#person/filter` should now log to the console

![](./resources/filter_log.png)

Yep, works. Lets go to implement the real logic. The first step will be to realize the view of the filter:

    //view of filter here…
    




# Todos

- relations, like belongsTo(..)
- setters and getters
