About six years ago I decided to create a Blogger account and start blogging. That worked perfectly and it was a good way to start blogging. However, now I think it's time to change.

## Changing the Domain
I will no longer continue blogging under [blog.js-development.com](http://blog.js-development.com) but rather under the domain [juristr.com](http://juristr.com). I think it's a more meaningful and representative domain name as I'm present with that acronym at a [variety](http://github.com/juristr) [of services](http://twitter.com/juristr). It stands for "Juri Strumpflohner" (as you might have guessed). I thought about using juristrumpflohner.com, however that seemed to long and hard to remember ;).

Still, [blog.js-development.com](http://blog.js-development.com) will remain as it is and I will keep it for now. Too many pages link to it in order to simply cut it off. What I did however is to migrate all six years of posting on js-development to juristr.com in order to preserve them.

## Changing the Blog Engine
I'm not only going to change the domain, but mainly the blogging engine. Yep, juristr.com is no more hosted on blogger, but on [Github](http://github.com) instead. The guys there just do an amazing job. They created [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), a static site generator which now also powers juristr.com.

## Why?
Why I changed from Blogger to Jekyll and Github?

1. Flexibility
2. Ease of writing
3. Freedom

Blogger is quite **flexible**, however - as most blogging engines - it is more oriented to the non-technical user. That means you can edit the HTML and fully customize the blog layout, however it'll quickly become difficult and messy. The currently layout I use at blog.js-development.com is a fully custom, handwritten layout and style, with lots of javascript code as well. Meaning, you can do it, but it quickly gets out of control and difficult to handle.

You could argue that the **"ease of writing"** is given as well at Blogger. Sure, since about a year they now have an amazing Gmail-like powered UI. The writing editor itself improved a lot as well, not to speak the recently added integration with Google+.  
But again, there are not many features for technical writers like myself. When posting source code, you need to first escape it in order to not destroy the post HTML. This involves a continuous switching between the HTML markup and WYSIWYG editor. _Markdown support_ would have been great!  
**Jekyll** provides Markdown support, which aloane makes it already more attractive for me: no more source code escaping, just write the post without wasting time at styling.

Moreover, since it's a static site generator it gives you the **maximum freedom** you'd expect. You can just change about anything you want, it's just pure HTML and a few Liquid templating tags. For the rest it's up to you, the CSS, JavaScript and so on. Moreover you aloane own the content of your blog and you're absolutely free to place it on any webserver capable of delivering static HTML files ;).
