## You're an Egghead.io Instructor? What does that mean?

Exactly! Since May 2017 I'm an Egghead.io instructor. That simply means I'm publishing single video lessons as well as courses on [Egghead.io](https://egghead.io). Egghead is know for its bite-sized lessons, delivering you just the knowledge you need right at that moment, coming from industry experts.
