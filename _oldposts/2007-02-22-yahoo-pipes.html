Yahoo recently launched a service called "<a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/">pipes</a>". Pipes are known from the Unix and Linux world, used in the shell to do for instance filtering etc...<br /><img src="http://juri.strumpflohner.googlepages.com/_yahoopipes.jpg" style="padding-left: 5px;" align="right" border="0" /><br />Their new service seems to be very interesting. They have created a nice workbench for creating, editing and debugging created pipes. There are some predefined operators which allow for example you to easily merge, truncate or filter out content of rss feeds.<br /><br />Each pipe that does some operation upon an RSS feed, will again have an output in XML (RSS) format. In this way the output of created pipes can directly be used by other applications and programmers don't have to write additional code for manipulating the feeds such that they meet their needs.<br /><br />What can also be noticed is that Yahoo! starts to emerge more  in the area of AJAX interfaces as Google already does heavily.
