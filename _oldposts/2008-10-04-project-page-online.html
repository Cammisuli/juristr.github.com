I just published my <a href="http://projects.js-development.com/">new project page</a>. Just take a look at it if you want...but don't expect too much :) There isn't yet much online. I'll add stuff over the time, some projects are still missing. The page should basically just be a place where all of my projects I'm involved in can be accessed and maybe some of you may also be interested in them.
