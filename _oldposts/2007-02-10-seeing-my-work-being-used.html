Yesterday after moving my old website to this blogger account, I surfed on the Internet without searching anything specifc. But then I discovered the website of <a href="http://www.study-board.de/map.php">Study-board </a>which is actually using an <a href="http://mitglied.lycos.de/kito85/GMap/Map.htm">old Google Map script</a> I wrote half a year ago. At that time I wrote the script basically to play a little around with the <a href="http://www.google.com/apis/maps/">Google Maps API</a>, mainly because of curiosity of how the API works.<br />In the meantime I successfully finished a project for the Internet Technologies II course at the University which was havily based on the Google Map API and therefore - as soon as time allows me -  I'm thinking of extending my inital <a href="http://mitglied.lycos.de/kito85/GMap/Map.htm">old Google Map script</a>. This came me in mind also because I saw that my script is not really that suitable for the way it is used on the <a href="http://www.study-board.de/map.php">Study-board</a> website. The script, but more specifically the actual layout of producing the output of the XML file was mainly designed for a few entries. The problem is that <a href="http://www.study-board.de/map.php">Study-board</a> uses the script for showing all their members, and therefore, the current way the script produces its output causes the website to extremely enlarge in height just to show all the cities contained in the XML file.<br />However, as soon as I will modify the script, I will post the result here on this blog with a detailed explanation.
