I personally use Gmail very intensively. This is not only because of its big storage capacity of (2,800 MB and growing) since now also other mail providers offer such amounts or even bigger ones, but mainly because of its intelligent way of organizing mails, because of the great handling of spams and especially for its fast response time due to its Ajax roots. At home I have only an ISDN connection to the internet which makes it very annoying when you have to wait till Hotmail loads all the graphics stuff till it finally lets you read your mails.<br /><br />Already for a longer time there exists the <a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=20616&topic=1571">feature of sending mails from inside Gmail using for instance your Yahoo! or Hotmail address</a>.<br />So I was used to forward emails from my other accounts directly to Gmail since it is simply easier to handle and keep track of all the mails there. The problem with forwarding is that your address of the forwarded account is shown as sender and not the real person that sent you the mail. So I stopped forwarding...<br /><a href="http://juri.strumpflohner.googlepages.com/_gmailPop.jpg" title="Screenshot" class="thickbox"><img src="http://juri.strumpflohner.googlepages.com/_gmailPopsmall.jpg" style="padding-left: 5px;" align="right" border="0" /></a>Already at that time the idea of a POP3 fetcher inside Gmail came me in mind and I spontaneously send a <a href="https://services.google.com/inquiry/gmail_suggest/">feature suggestion</a> to the Gmail team on their predefined website.<br />Probably due to requests also from  many other users, some month later I found an entry of such a feature in the <a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=21288&topic=1565">Gmail Help</a>, however it was available only for a limited amount of users. Today I tried it out and I can ensure that it works for Italy now :D . You just have to go to your Settings (inside Gmail) and then open the tab "Accounts". If you see there the section "Get mail from other accounts", then you can access the feature.<br /><br />According to a post entry to <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/02/anyone-can-signup-for-gmail-account.html">this blog</a> GMail should now also be available to the public in Middle East and Africa, Brazil, Australia, Russia and Japan. I personally didn't try it out now, but someone at Google must have released the notice of going public to early...<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">1st Screenshot</span><br /><a href="http://juri.strumpflohner.googlepages.com/_gmailHelp1.gif" title="Screenshot" class="thickbox"><img src="http://juri.strumpflohner.googlepages.com/_gmailHelp1small.gif" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">some days later...</span><br /><a href="http://juri.strumpflohner.googlepages.com/_gmailHelp.jpg" title="Screenshot" class="thickbox"><img src="http://juri.strumpflohner.googlepages.com/_gmailHelpsmall.jpg" border="0" /></a>
