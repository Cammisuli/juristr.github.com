I recently got an invitation to attend the world's first virtual summit on the future of storytelling. Unfortunately I'm quite busy these weeks and therefore I'll not be able to attend.<a href="http://www.reinventionsummit.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/ReinventionSummit250x250.gif" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://www.reinventionsummit.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/ReinventionSummit250x250.gif" /></a> Nevertheless I'd like to share the event with some of you out there which may be interested to participate.<br />My current time constraint is also why I'll not going to write a lot now, and it's also the reason why my new post frequency is quite low at the moment. But hey, lots of unfinished, interesting stuff is in the drafts folder waiting to be published :)<br /><br />So here are the details about the event (taken from <a href="http://www.reinventionsummit.com/bloggers/">reinventionsummit.com</a>):<br /><br /><b>WHAT:</b> This two-week virtual conference will focus on the power of the narrative to challenge assumptions and identify ways to change the world. Via webinar and online voice and video calls, business leaders and social change-makers will share best practices for creating and delivering stories that can help us to reinvent – as organizations and individuals.<br /><br /><b>WHO:</b> Michael Margolis, president of Get Storied, has organized a list of speakers to present summit content and engage people across disciplines.

A longtime storytelling consultant, Margolis focuses on the power of narrative — the most basic and emotionally resonant form of human communication.<br /><br />Have fun and stay tuned for new interesting posts ;)
