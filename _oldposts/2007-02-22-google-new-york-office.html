<a href="http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2007/02/19/gothamist_goes_to_google.php">This article</a> describes the new Google NY Office, opened about 4 month ago.<br />Their work environment and condition sound a little futuristic...<br /><br /><blockquote>"..., the floor plan evolved to include approximately four micro kitchens equipped with snacks, a game room, idea boards, a lecture hall, two cafes, majestic ten foot tall windows, and conference rooms named for New York City landmarks, such as Belvedere Castle and Rockefeller Center,..."</blockquote><br /><blockquote>"The primary colors of Google’s logo are reflected throughout the office where every day of the week Google makes life colorful for its employees. Tuesday afternoons, employees enjoy tea and in the evenings relax with Yoga. On Wednesdays, they exercise with pilates.   By Thursday the office is ready to celebrate with TGIF- Thank God It’s Almost Friday- with different teams sponsoring themes, most recently the audio team coordinated karaoke. [...]<br />And those are just the designated days—everyday, employees can head into Game Room, converted from the Port Authority’s old loading dock, to play ping pong, Air Guitar, foosball, and pool or enjoy a relaxing massage in a chair."</blockquote>If that's really the situation there..... *jealousy* :)
