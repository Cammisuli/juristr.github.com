Using so-called "task-lists" or "todo-lists" for keeping track of the things one has to do, becomes more and more popular. Many <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar">Google Calendar</a> users for instance <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/google-calendar-help-misc/browse_frm/thread/ba9455a61d74de84">request for such a feature</a> to be implemented directly inside it. Till now the Google Calendar team did not react to this requests at all, however according to <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Google/?p=170">this article</a> there are pieces of code inside the Calendar script that indicate a possible implementation of such a feature.<br />I personally must admit that I like todo lists too. <a href="http://juri.strumpflohner.googlepages.com/_voo2doo.jpg" title="Screenshot" class="thickbox"><img src="http://juri.strumpflohner.googlepages.com/_voo2doosmall.jpg" style="padding-left: 5px;" align="right" border="0" /></a>They are useful, especially when organizing my little programming projects, since you can break down your work and - if you manage the list properly - you won't forget or miss anything. The problem is to find the appropriate software that matches ones needs. I'm in search more for todo-tools that go in the direction of project management. There are a lot of professional tools (MS Project,...), however mostly they are too detailed for little home-made software projects. There is a lot of stuff available on the web (also Open source projects), but many of them are complicated to configure or to work with them. At first in my eyes such applications must find a balance between the amount of implemented features that make up the "completeness" of such an application and the easiness of usage.<br />The features that make a task-managing application useful are things like sharing or collaboration (both could be solved via a web-based apps), prioritization, assignment of categories (bugs, improvement,...) etc. <a href="http://voo2do.com/">Voo2doo </a>is an example of such a web-based todo-list that includes many of the before listed features. I currently use it for my <a href="http://mitglied.lycos.de/kito85/project/CodeNotebook/index.htm">Code Notebook project</a> and it works fine. The advantage that it clearly has is that it is web-based and in this way accessible from everywhere and so also easy to publish on a website. <a href="http://juri.strumpflohner.googlepages.com/_ToDoList.jpg" title="Screenshot" class="thickbox"><img src="http://juri.strumpflohner.googlepages.com/_ToDoListsmall.jpg" style="padding-left: 5px;" align="right" border="0" /></a>Beside Voo2doo I tried out also <a href="http://code.google.com/hosting/">Google's Project hosting</a> service. If you want to create an open source project this is for sure beside <a href="http://sourceforge.net/">Sourceforge </a>one of the best solutions, since you have everything in one place, from a project homepage, download area and wiki to a separate svn repository. And there they actually have included some kind of task or todo-list. It is an issue tracking system which is not only for developers of the project, but is thought also as a place where users can add feedback or bug-reports. It is fully customizable and prepared text templates help users to report bugs such that they are better understandable for the developers.<br />However what I'm currently using is a desktop-application called <a href="http://www.abstractspoon.com/tdl_resources.html">"ToDo list"</a>. I use it since a couple of days now and have not explored all of its features yet, but it seems to be great. It includes the basic features like ordering for categories, assigning priorities etc..but also more advanced features such as time-tracking, assigning of costs, breaking down task into several subtasks and so on. It really seems to be complete in the sense of features and easy to use at the same time. It is worth to give it a try.
