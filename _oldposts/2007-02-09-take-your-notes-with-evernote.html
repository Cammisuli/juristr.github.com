You can create different types of notes, from basic text-notes, handwritten ink-notes to several types of to-do and shopping. It also includes an extension for Firefox and Internet Explorer to directly and notes from there or to save a complete website.<br /><br /> Another thing that is supported is source code pasting. So in some sense it is similar to my <a href="http://mitglied.lycos.de/kito85/project/CodeNotebook/index.htm">Code Notebook</a>.<br /> The difference is that I considered <a href="http://mitglied.lycos.de/kito85/project/CodeNotebook/index.htm">Code Notebook</a> (as also the name says) explicitly as a source-code storing unit. Storing source-codes in <a href="http://www.evernote.com/en/" target="window">EverNote</a> is simply based on formatting. A simple text-node template is created with a special formatting such as using the Courier New as source-code font.<br /><br /> Anyway there are nice features I could implement in <a href="http://mitglied.lycos.de/kito85/project/CodeNotebook/index.htm">Code Notebook</a>. Currently I am thinking to<br /> put some kind of Todo-list, bookmarking and maybe an option to store not only source-codes but to store other notes where one would have<br /> better formatting options.
