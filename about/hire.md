### What am I look for

My current interest are based in the frontend web development area, which is why I'm currently mainly looking for a **full-time, remote position** as a tech lead with focus on frontend web development.  
I'm [very interested backend architectures](/about#interests) as well, especially distributed systems and the whole topics around microservices and containers (Docker, ...).

But I'm always keen to explore new fields. So if you think I could be a good match, then let's discuss. Just [contact me](/about#contact). I'm looking forward to hearing from you!

### What I am doing on a day to day basis at my current job

Currently I'm working as a **software architect** for an e-government company. The better description for the role is problably the one of a tech lead as I do **lots of coding** on a daily basis. I help **design software solutions**, create the **base-line architecture** and discuss it with my team. I'm usually then heavily involved in coding the most difficult/tough parts of the system myself and/or by giving support to my team members.

I mostly contribute on the frontend side (where usually most difficulties arise), using JavaScript and Angular, but also on the backend where I code in C# and Java.

### What's most important to me

I want to work for a company...

- which **values people** in the first place
- which knows about the value of **motivated employees and good company culture**
- which **values quality** over quantity
- which **helps me grow** with them, be and remain innovative at an international level
- which doesn't care when, where or for how long I work, **but rather how I work and what I produce**
- which **isn't built on top of huge organizational hierarchies**
- which embraces **open source**

### My professional goals for the next few years

- attend more conferences
- become more active in the community (i.e. speak at conferences)
- be more influential
