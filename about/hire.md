### What kind of job are you looking for?

I'm looking for a job as a frontend or full stack developer with the possibility to eventually grow into the role as a tech lead. I'm particularly interested in JavaScript based frontends and also Node.js. That's where I'm currently most active in the community, but I'm keen to explore new fields as well which I'm happy to discuss with you.

I'm currently mainly looking for a **full-time, remote position**.

### What are you doing right now at your current job on a day to day basis?

Currently I'm working as a **software architect** for an e-government company. The better description for the role is problably the one of a tech lead as I do **lots of coding** on a daily basis. I help **design software solutions**, create the **base-line architecture** and discuss it with my team. I'm usually then heavily involved in coding the most difficult/tough parts of the system myself and/or by giving support to my team members.

I mostly contribute on the frontend side (where usually most difficulties arise), using JavaScript and Angular, but also on the backend where I code in C# and Java.

### What's important to you?

I want to work for a company...

- which **values people** in the first place
- which recognizes the value behind effective (not useless) **communication**
- which knows about the value of **motivated employee and good company culture**
- which **helps me grow** with them, be and remain innovative at an international level
- which doesn't care when, where or for how long I work, **but rather how I work and what I produce**
- which **values quality** over quantity
- which **isn't built on top of huge organizational hierarchies**
- which embraces **open source**

### What are your goals for the next few years?

- attend more conferences
- become more active in the community (i.e. speak at conferences)
