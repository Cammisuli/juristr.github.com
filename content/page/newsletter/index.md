# Juri's Brain Dump aka "Newsletter"

Hey :wave:

yes I launched a newsletter. Well, I don't like the term "newsletter" as it sounds like spammy advertising emails. Instead, let's call it my "brain dump" as this is really what it is. From now and then you might get some very sophisticated email, with some research behind etc..and other times just some random thoughts ðŸ˜….

**Topics are mostly around software development**, from web tech, agile development and other kind of things you might come across in your daily life as a developer.  Wanna see? Check out [some of my previous emails](https://us4.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=04e83acc0ba14b18f30435204&id=1d83b68321).
