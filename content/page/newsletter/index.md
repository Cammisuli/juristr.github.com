Hey :wave:

Yes, I decided to launch a newsletter. **Why?** It's an experiment I'd like to try. As a Google Developers Expert, software engineer and freelance trainer, I'm continously learning new things. And I've always had the passion to share those learnings, either by [writing articles](/blog) or creating [video courses on Egghead](https://egghead.io/instructors/juri-strumpflohner) or on my [Youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/c/JuriStrumpflohner).

Writing proper articles or creating video lessons takes time, and sometimes I'd just like to quickly share some thoughts, some cool article I found on the web or let you know about that new video course I just released. That's where a newsletter fits in perfectly. Moreover, I'd like to use it as an early feedback for articles and video courses I'm going to publish :wink:

So if this is something that sounds interesting to you, here's the form to subscribe :smiley:
