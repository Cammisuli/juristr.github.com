Hey :wave:

Yes, I decided to launch a newsletter. **Why?** It's an experiment I'd like to try. As a Google Developers Expert, software engineer and freelance trainer, I'm continously learning new things. And I've always had the passion to share those learnings, either by [writing articles](/blog) or creating [video courses on Egghead](https://egghead.io/instructors/juri-strumpflohner) or on my [Youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/c/JuriStrumpflohner).

Writing proper articles or creating video lessons takes time, and somethings you'd just quickly share some thoughts, some cool article you found on the web or even tell others about that new course you released. That's where a newsletter fits in perfectly. Moreover, I'd like to use it as an early feedback for articles and video courses I'm going to create :wink:

So if this is something that sounds interesting to you, here's the form to subscribe :smiley:
