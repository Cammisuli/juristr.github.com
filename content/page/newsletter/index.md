Hey :wave:

Yes, I decided to launch a newsletter. **Why?** It's an experiment I'd like to try. The thing is, as a Google Developers Expert in Web Tech, software engineer and freelance trainer, I'm continously learning new things. Most of them result in either [Video courses on Egghead](https://egghead.io/instructors/juri-strumpflohner) or [articles on my blog](/blog). But writing a proper tech article takes a lot of time and my draft articles start to pile up. 

Sometimes I'd like to **quickly share something interesting**, some nice article I found on the web, some thoughts/experiments and get it out there. Again, many of them will end up in one of my articles or videos. That said, you somehow get "early access to my future content" :wink:.

Great, so if this is something that sounds interesting to you, here's the form to subscribe :smiley:
