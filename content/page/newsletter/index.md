Hey :wave:

yes I launched a newsletter. Well, I don't like the term "newsletter" as it sounds like spammy advertising emails. Instead, think of it more like **having my brain connected to your inbox**. I like to send thoughts, new interesting articles I discover, some videos I create or blog posts I wrote or am about to write. Wanna see? Check out [some of my previous emails](https://us4.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=04e83acc0ba14b18f30435204&id=1d83b68321).

I like to see this as a more direct connection to you, different to my blog articles which is more broadcasting into the wild. So if this is something that sounds interesting to you, here's the form to subscribe :smiley:
