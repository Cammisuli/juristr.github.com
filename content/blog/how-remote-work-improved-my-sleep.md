Before starting to work remotely, I did work on-site at a company. That meant getting up at around 6am, breakfast, prepping myself and then drive for 20min to the main town where the company I worked for was located. That’s not too bad, right, people have to drive even up to an hour to get to work sometimes. 

The bad thing is the “hard deadline” in the morning at 6am, when the alarm started! Why? Well because you have to get up early :sweat_smile:, but mainly because at that time I usually just averaged around 6 to 6.5 hours of sleep per night. I tried to get to bed before 11pm, but that turned out to be hard as you have dinner, talk with you partner, watch some TV and bam, it’s 11pm.

## Sleep less, get more done!

Yep, I definitely had that phase. I still stay up late sometimes after work, to finish that blog post (just as right now) which has been in the drafts for a while, or play around with that side project. But it happens less often (maybe I’m just getting old...and yes, kids play a role as well :smiley:)

## Improvements

- not having a hard deadline in the morning aka no alarm that wakes you up
- going to bed at 11pm and waking up at 7am (on average)

## Challenging

- kids :)
