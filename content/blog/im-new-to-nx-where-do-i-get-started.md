## Website, Sourcecode and Documentation

- **[Nrwl Website](https://nrwl.io) -** Nrwl is the company behind the open source tool Nx
- **[Nx Documentation](https://nx.dev) -** this is the official documentation for Nx.
- **[Nx Github](https://github.com/nrwl/nx) -** Nx is open source, so all of the code is up here

## Video Courses

If you like watching videos rather than reading through articles and the docs, here are some options:

- **[Scale React Development with Nx](https://egghead.io/playlists/scale-react-development-with-nx-4038) -** completely free course with over 1h 30min of content. It focuses on React, but since Nx is a tech agnostic CLI, most of the shown commands can be easily translated to Angular as well.
- **[Nx Playbook](https://nxplaybook.com/) -** the Nx Playbook site is Nrwls channel for official Nx videos. It comes with some free intro course as well as a paid more advanced Nx course
- **[Nx Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF8luR7ORJTCwSNA9yZksCw) -** ddasdf
