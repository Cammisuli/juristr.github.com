{{<intro>}}
  If you are new to [Nx](https://nx.dev), but curious, here are a couple of pointers and links where and how to get started.

## Website, Sourcecode and Documentation

- **[Nrwl Website](https://nrwl.io) -** Nrwl is the company behind the open source tool Nx
- **[Nx Documentation](https://nx.dev) -** this is the official documentation for Nx.
- **[Nx Github](https://github.com/nrwl/nx) -** Nx is open source, so all of the code is up here
- **[Weekly Office hours](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF8luR7ORJTCwSNA9yZksCw) -** Register on Nrwls Youtube channel
- **[Nrwl Newsletter](https://go.nrwl.io/nrwl-news) -** subscribe to get the latest Nrwl & Nx news, links to community resources, office hours and other important info  

## Video Courses

If you like watching videos rather than reading through articles and the docs, here are some options:

- **[Scale React Development with Nx](https://egghead.io/playlists/scale-react-development-with-nx-4038) -** completely free course with over 1h 30min of content. It focuses on React, but since Nx is a tech agnostic CLI, most of the shown commands can be easily translated to Angular as well.
- **[Nx Playbook](https://nxplaybook.com/) -** the Nx Playbook site is Nrwls channel for official Nx videos. It comes with some free intro course as well as a paid more advanced Nx course
- **[Nrwls Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF8luR7ORJTCwSNA9yZksCw) -** Nrwls official Youtube channel where the team regularly shares tutorial videos about Nx as well as the recordings of the regular office hours

## Talks

I wouldn't probably be able to keep all the talks up to date here, so I'm linking directly to the Nx readme which has an up-to-date list on it
